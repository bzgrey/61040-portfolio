# Assignment 2:
## Problem Statement

**Problem Domain**: <u>Learning Torah</u> - I view Torah, the foundational text of Judaism as well as all of the books written based on it (including the Talmud), as a foundational and essential part of my life. I do my best to spend a significant amount of time each day learning the Torah, often with a learning partner (chavrusa). There are many different fields of the Torah that I enjoy learning, from the Talmud (foundational book of Jewish oral tradition and law) and the Tanach (Jewish Bible) to books explaining Jewish thought and faith.

**Problem**: <u>Remembering Torah</u> - Those who learn Torah often find it hard to remember well what they have learned or to review the material well. Often one will go to a class in Torah and will not take notes or will take bad notes that are hard to review.

**Stakeholders**: 
1. Learner of Torah: This is the person who learns Torah and has a problem remembering it.
2. Teacher of Torah: This is the person who teaches it and wants his students to remember what he taught them.
3. God: God wants Jews to be learning his Torah.

**Evidence and Comparables**:  
1. [Spaced repetition improves long-term retention](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaced_repetition?utm_source=chatgpt.com): Research shows that using flashcards with spaced repetition significantly boosts memory performance over time, making it a proven method for retaining learned material. This could help people remember Torah.
2. [Quizlet](https://quizlet.com/) is a popular flashcard website that is similar in the flashcards being shared.
3. There are a [number](https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/77963/memory-techniques-for-torah?utm_source=chatgpt.com) of successful stupy apps, so it is proven to be a useful idea.
4. [Sefaria](sefaria.org) is an example of a [popular](https://www.reddit.com/r/Jewish/comments/1jza2uj/any_apps_for_free_torah_study/?utm_source=chatgpt.com) website with Torah sources, although it doesn't focuse on review. 
5.  A lot of review is very valued in [rabbinic sources](https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/77963/memory-techniques-for-torah?utm_source=chatgpt.com) so it is definitely something that a lot of people would value having a useful tool for it. 
6. There are other daily Torah study apps that don't specifically focus on memorization, like the [Chabad study app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?hl=en_US&id=org.chabad.android.DailyStudy&utm_source=chatgpt.com)
7. [Zichru](https://www.zichru.com/) is a program for remembering daily Talmud study, but it is not collaborative. One just uses what is placed on the website for review. It does have an interesting custom quiz option.
8. [This article](https://etzion.org.il/en/halakha/studies-halakha/philosophy-halakha/importance-reviewing-and-remembering) brings a number of sources from rabbinic literature about the importance of remembering the Torah that one learns, so if people find this webapp useful, they would have good reason to use it consistently.
