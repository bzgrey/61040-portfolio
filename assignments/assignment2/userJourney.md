A rabbinical student is studying the laws of the Jewish Sabbath (*Shabbos*) and he has an examination coming up on these laws that will help him gain his ordination as a rabbi. He opens up TorahCards and clicks on the new button next to "my flashcards" to create flashcards on the laws of the Sabbath. He inputs multiple question and answers based on his notes and his readings to study for the test. He also gives it a label of "Laws of Shabbos" so others can find it.
He also adds his notes to the website with the same label.

The next day he navigates to his "Laws of Shabbos" notes, studies them, and then goes to the flashcards and studies them, reading the question and thinking of the answer before flipping the card to check if he is correct and then moving on to the next one.

He shares the notes and flashcards with his fellow students so that they can also study his flashcards in the same way for the test.
