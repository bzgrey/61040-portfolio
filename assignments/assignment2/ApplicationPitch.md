# Application Pitch

**Name**: TorahCards

**Motivation**: TorahCards will create a collaborative environment for people to create material which they can study in order to remember the Torah that they were forgetting.

**Key Features**: 
1. Flash Cards: Users who want to be able to review what they learned will be able to create flash cards on different topics with any questions with which they can test themselves and then mark which ones they know well and which they need to review more.
2. Notes: Users can store their notes on different Torah topics in a useful and convenient place from which they can access them to review, and they can also  be inputed into an llm to create a set of flashcards with questions about the notes.
3. Sharing: Different users can make their notes and flashcards public and share them with friends or students to be used by others, and users can search for notes and flashcards that were made by other users on topics in Torah that they are interested in. This will help both teachers and learners of Torah in sharing Torah in a reviewable way.
