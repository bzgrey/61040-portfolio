# Assignment 1 (6.104) - Benjamin Grey

## Domains
1. <u>Learning Torah</u> - I view Torah, the foundational text of Judaism as welll as all of the books written based on it (including the Talmud), as a foundational and essential part of my life. I do my best to spend a significant amount of time each day learning the Torah, often with a learning partner (chavrusa). There are many different fields of the Torah that I enjoy learning, from the Talmud (foundational book of Jewish oral tradition and law) and the Tanach (Jewish Bible) to books explaining Jewish thought and faith.
2. Hiking - Great way to get refreshed from being inside in the non-nature most days.
3. Yeshivas - Jewish learning seminary for Torah
4. <u>School</u> - I go to MIT. I feel like I have a love/hate relationship with school in general and MIT specifically. I usually overwork myself even though I mostly enjoy the classes I am taking. I enjoy the community and people in MIT.
5. Computer Science - my major at MIT
6. Physics - most interesting subject
7. Baseball - Favorite sport growing up.
8. <u>Prayers/Gabbinate</u> - As a Jew I pray formally 3 times a day, and informally throughout the day. These times of prayer are supposed to be very meaningful, but often I can be very distracted by life and find it hard to focus. Additionally, at MIT, I am part of the "Gabbinate" a small group of Jewish students who organize the larger group for each of the 3 "minyans" - quorums or 10 people - each day. 
9. Running - I enjoy running after a long day of work and learning and sitting.
10. Listening to music - Listening to music makes me happy.


## Problems (selection under each problem)
- Learning Torah:
    1. Remembering Torah: I often find it hard to remember well what I 
    have learned or to review the material well. Often I will go to a class in Torah and I will not take notes or I will take bad notes that are hard to review.
        - Selected: I think this could be a good option, because one could use a site to share notes of flash cards, etc. on different areas of Torah with others. Additionally, there are a lot of people who have this problem, and making it collaborative could help people out, and it would grow itself. 
    2. Choosing what Torah to learn: Often when I find time to learn Torah, I will find trouble deciding what I want to learn and for how long I want to learn, and I will change my mind in the middle often. 
        - Not Selected: I don't think that a website would really be better at making decisions for this kind of thing, and also most people would get tired of using it.
    3. Finding people with whom to learn: Torah is best learned with partners or in a group, because it is often easier to focus with a partner and the back and forth between partners helps them learn better. The problem is that often it is hard to find a good partner who has a similar level of learning and commitment with the same free hours to learn. 
        - I think there is already a website that connects people to be learning partners. Also, it would be quite a large project.

- School:
    1. School/life Balance: I have trouble timing how long it will take for me to get homework done and in turn balancing it with everything else in life. Because of the uncertainty of how long it will take for me to get my homework done, I often neglect or put off doing other things until I get my homework done even though I could have had time ot finish it later. 
        - Selected: I am choosing this becuase I think many people struggle with this problem, and I think if poeple were to have an organized way of keeping track of how long they take to do assignments compared to how long they thought it would take, they could probably plan for homework more efficiently. Additionally, this data could be used to help inform other peoples decisions on classes and how much time to dedicate to their homework.
    2. Class Outcomes: Often there is uncertainty about how useful a class will actually be in the workforce or how interesting the class will be. People often end up taking classes that they think will be useful or interesting and then find the opposite.
        - Not Selected: There are already class review websites, and for this to get good data, it would have to ask questions of alumni years after they graduate, which would be hard to do.
    3. Taking Notes: Sometimes people have trouble taking good notes for a class, or they may have to miss class for some reason, and they then have a hard time studying for and succeeding on tests. Others take good notes, so there is a note-taking imbalance and inefficiency of shared notes. 
        - Not Selected: Professors may not be so happy with note sharing. Also, note taking is meant to be done by everyone so they retain the material well.

- Prayers/Gabbinate:
    1. Minyan Recruiting: Spending time each day recruiting 10 people (a "minyan") for three prayer services can take a lot of time and be stressful. The way it is currently done is through a whatsapp group chat, but it takes sending reminders and everything which is quite distracting throughout the day.
        - Selected: I think that this would be an interesting problem to solve as it is a result of inefficiencies in communication. Assitionally, there are prayer services around the world that could use this. Maybe a whatsapp API could be used to automate message sending, etc., and keep track of where one is at.
    2. Concentration and Understanding: Since the liturgy of the three prayer services don't change much throughout the week and they are in a formal language, it can become easy to say them by rote and forget to focus on the meaning of the prayers. Often people don't even learn the meaning, which is a problem. 
        - Not Selected: Prayers are generally done without computers, so it would be quite hard to make a website to help with this.
    3. Faith and Trust: In order to get the most out of one's prayers they must have faith that their prayers are being heard and trust that no matter the outcome, it is for the best. Given that God is not visible, it can be quite heard to really feel like one is being heard or seen. Also, given the many challenges of life, it can become quite hard to really have full trust in God that everything is for the best. 
        - Not Selected: This also is not the type of thing that would be solved by technology. This is more or a people thing, and it takes good examples and education.

3 Selections (see above for reasons): Minyan Recruiting, Remembering Torah, and School/life balance

## Stakeholders

- Minyan Recruiting: Recruiter (the one doing the minyan recruiting), Minyan Member (someone who frequently goes to the minyan), Non minyan member (someone who doesn't frequently go to the minyan). Impacts: The recruiter would hopefully have an easier time recruiting for minyan. The minyan member may not want to use another app for something instead of whatsapp, or he may prefer having it separate. A nonmember may have a higher barrier of entry to the minyan.

- Remebering Torah: The person who wants to create their own ways of remembering Torah will have a good place to store their notes, trivia questions, etc. The person who wants notes/summaries or quiz questions for something they are learning will have a place to find them. The students of anyone who is learning that material will be affected as they will now have a more knowlegeable teacher.

- School/life balance: School students would be affected as they could use the website to better keep track of themeselves and how long they take to do certain work. Other students could then benefit from that information as it would help them better know the length of certain assignments or how much homework a class has. The professors would be affected as they would then be able to see how long people are taking to do their assignments and be able to recalibrate the length of them.

## Evidence

- Remembering Torah:
    1. [Spaced repetition improves long-term retention](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaced_repetition?utm_source=chatgpt.com): Research shows that using flashcards with spaced repetition significantly boosts memory performance over time, making it a proven method for retaining learned material.
    2. [Quizlet](https://quizlet.com/) is a popular flashcard website that is similar in the flashcards being shared.
    3. There are a [number](https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/77963/memory-techniques-for-torah?utm_source=chatgpt.com) of successful stupy apps, so it is proven to be a useful idea.
    4. [Sefaria](sefaria.org) is an example of a [popular](https://www.reddit.com/r/Jewish/comments/1jza2uj/any_apps_for_free_torah_study/?utm_source=chatgpt.com) website with Torah sources, although it doesn't focuse on review. 
    5.  A lot of review is very valued in [rabbinic sources](https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/77963/memory-techniques-for-torah?utm_source=chatgpt.com) so it is definitely something that a lot of people would value have a useful tool for it. 
    6. There are other daily Torah study apps that don't specifically focus on memorization, like the [Chabad study app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?hl=en_US&id=org.chabad.android.DailyStudy&utm_source=chatgpt.com)
    7. [Zichru](https://www.zichru.com/) is a program for remembering daily Talmud study, but it is not collaborative. One just uses what is placed on the website for review. It does have an interesting custom quiz option.

-  Minyan Recruiting:
    1. Using phones for notifications and spending a lot of time recruiting can be [distracting](https://www.nirandfar.com/hack-back-phone-distractions/).
    2. [WhatsApp Reminder tools](https://gallabox.com/blog/whatsapp-reminder-softwares?utm_source=chatgpt.com): There's a growing niche of software that automates reminders via WhatsApp—useful for appointments, payments, events, etc.—which could be adapted for prayer reminders.
    3. [AI-based scheduling bots](https://zapia.com/blog/recuing-reminders?lang=en&utm_source=chatgpt.com): Tools like Zapia offer AI-enabled recurring reminders directly through WhatsApp chats—set once, delivered automatically on schedule.
    4. [GoDaven](https://www.godaven.com/) is a minyan database that helps people find minyans around the world, although it doesn't have very well maintained information. This can show that a lot of people are looking for minyans and could find this useful.
    5. [Statistics of GoDaven](https://jewishvues.com/articles/qa-with-dr-yosi-fishkin-founder-of-godaven-com/#:~:text=19%20Nov%20Q&A%20With%20Dr,coming%20from%202%2C000%2D3%2C000%20individual): There are over 6,300 minyan locations just on GoDaven listed, and it has 14,000-17,000 hits per day, so many of those users could go to the minyan recruiting website.
    6. There are almost [15 million](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jewish_population_by_country#:~:text=As%20of%202025%2C%20the%20world's,and%20interfaith%20marriage%20by%20Jews.) Jews in the world, a siginificant percentage being religious, leaving a large group of possible users.
    7. Many communities already coordinate through WhatsApp, which is extremely entrenched. Research shows that introducing new apps faces [“network effects”](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_effect?utm_source=chatgpt.com) resistance—people stick to what everyone is already using.
    8. Sharing religious attendance information (who did or didn’t attend minyan) could create social pressure, embarrassment, or unwanted exposure. Studies show [privacy concerns](https://walton.uark.edu/insights/posts/how-security-an-privacy-concerns-shape-app-usage.php#:~:text=To%20decipher%20this%2C%20they%20conducted,personal%20information%20provided%20by%20users.) often undermine the adoption of community or tracking apps.

- School/life balance:
    1. [Studeam](https://taskntime.org/en/studeam-4/?utm_source=chatgpt.com) is a app that already does something similar in creating a study plan students. It doesn't have the social aspect of it in sharing the times with other people who take the same classes though. 
    2. [87% of students](https://www.listening.com/blog/the-six-best-time-management-apps-for-students?utm_source=chatgpt.com) "feel buried under the mountain of schoolwork", indicating that there are a lot of people who could benefit from something helping them manage that and the stress.
    3. [Studies show](https://bcsnygroup.com/dealing-with-the-stress-of-uncertainty/#:~:text=Why%20Does%20Uncertainty%20Cause%20Stress,cope%20with%20ambiguity%20more%20constructively.) that uncertainty causes stress, and an app that helps one determine how much time something would take would be able to counteract the uncertainty.
    4. There already exist [MIT subject evaluation reports](https://eduapps.mit.edu/ose-rpt/?Search+Online+Reports=Search+Subject+Evaluation+Reports) for subjects, where people report how many hours they spent per week on classes, but it's not as specific as reporting time per pset or something similar. 
    5. There are similarly [hydrant](https://hydrant.mit.edu/) and [courseroad](https://courseroad.mit.edu/) which are very popular and report the hours per class.
    6. [LMS data is commonly used](https://learninganalytics.upenn.edu/ryanbaker/JLA-Vita.pdf?utm_source=chatgpt.com) to estimate online learning time, but its accuracy can be problematic—differences in estimation methods can significantly affect analytics outcomes.
    7. [Productivity apps with schedule optimization](https://www.reddit.com/r/ProductivityApps/comments/1dak6vs/best_app_to_break_down_assignments_and_schedule/?utm_source=chatgpt.com): Users on Reddit recommend Motion and Skedpal; these apps can intake due dates, priorities, and time estimates and then automatically schedule tasks around other commitments.
    
## Features

- Remembering Torah:
    1. Make quizes/flash cards out of summaries: Use an llm to create quizes out of summaries that the users made. This would both help learners of Torah create ways to test and review what they have learned. 
    2. Sharing: Allow notes/flashcards/quizes to be shared between users, and they can be made for different texts that are commonly used, like the Talmud. Teachers could use this to test their students.
    3. Madlibs: Users can make custom madlibs stories to test their knowledge. 

- Minyan Recruiting:
    1. Scheduled Sign-ups: Schedule sending out minyan sign-up tests. This would take away the need to manually send a sign-up text every day.
    2. Minyan groups: Create minyan groups on the website to which texts are broadcasted.
    3. Scheduled reminders to sign up: Choose people to text intermittently asking if they can make it to minyan if they didn't sign up. This way the recruiter won't have to repeatedly send texts to different people.

- School/life balance:
    1. Estimated vs. Actual times: Users input the time they estimate they will spend on an assignment and then use a built-in timer to give the real amount of time, and then the webapp will learn the person's work habits.
    2. Time predictions: From learning the user's habits, the webapp will give predictions on how long the assignment will actually take.
    3. Custom schedules: Using the estimated and predicted times, create a custom schedule for users, which would allow them to plan out their days.
